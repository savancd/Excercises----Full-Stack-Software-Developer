                        <p>It's wonderful to have such a strong group of individuals from Serbia and the Philippines who are linked through marriage and friendship.
                            One method to bring our group together and build our bonds is to create a virtual area where we can interact, communicate, and share our experiences.

                <p>
                    We are creating  a website that serves as a community
                     platform for Filipinos and Serbians 
                     <strong>
                         <em>
                             ( and many others
                             who want to join us ).
                         </em>
                     </strong>
                </p>
               
                <p>
                    We think that this is a great idea as it can bring people
                    together and provide a space for them to connect and
                        communicate with each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make this website successful, it will be important for us
                     to provide a wide range of information and resources that
                      are relevant to both Filipinos and Serbians. This might 
                      include news, cultural events, resources for language 
                      learning, and information about business and career 
                      opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition, we gonna consider in the future adding features that make it
                    easy for people to connect & communicate with each other, such as forums,
                    chat rooms, or social networking functionality. This can help foster a sense
                    of community and encourage users to return to the site regularly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, it will be important to ensure that the website is
                    well-designed and easy to navigate (we gonna work on this
                    constantly). This can help make it more appealing to all of
                    you & encourage you to spend more time on the site.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Overall, building a community platform for Filipinos and Serbians is gonna be a
                    rewarding and worthwhile project. With careful planning and attention to the
                    needs and interests of our community, we gonna create a website that serves
                    as a valuable resource for people from both cultures.
                </p>
                
                <p>Remember that this website is here to bring all of us together, so it's
                    great to see that we have a community of people from around 
                    the world who are connected through marriage and friendship.

                </p>    
                <!-- <p>
                    You can find information on our website and connect with 
                    like-minded people who are also interested in the Serbian 
                    and Filipino community. This will be a great way to meet new 
                    friends, discover new recipes, and keep in touch with people
                     outside of our and your local community.
