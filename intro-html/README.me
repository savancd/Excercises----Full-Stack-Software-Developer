# This was my first assignment in ** Introduction to Web Development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript **

Assignment was just to change few lines of text as a first task but I decided to do much more and to style it with CSS and to make it in my own way.

> The purpose is to push myself out of my comfort zone and to learn much faster.
